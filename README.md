# Succession Moods

This project is a Django-based web application that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and visualize the emotional tones of characters from HBOâ€™s Succession. By processing and interpreting dialogue data, this tool reveals insights into the underlying emotions and sentiments of each character throughout the series, providing fans and analysts with a deeper understanding of character development and relationships.

<br>

## Features to Come

- **Character Emotion Analysis**: Uses NLP to extract emotional tone from dialogue and attributes it to individual characters.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive visualizations of emotional trends and shifts for each character.
- **Character Comparison**: Compare emotional trends across multiple characters to see dynamics and contrast over time.
- **Episode and Season Filtering**: Analyze emotional changes episode-by-episode or across entire seasons.

<br>

## Technologies Used

- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) : Web framework used to build the backend and handle routing.
- [PyMuPDF](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) : Python library for data extraction from PDF file.
