# Succession Character Emotion Analysis

This project is a Django-based web application that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and visualize the emotional tones of characters from HBOâ€™s Succession. By processing and interpreting dialogue data, this tool reveals insights into the underlying emotions and sentiments of each character throughout the series, providing fans and analysts with a deeper understanding of character development and relationships.

## Features

- **Character Emotion Analysis**: Uses NLP to extract emotional tone from dialogue and attributes it to individual characters.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive visualizations of emotional trends and shifts for each character.
- **Character Comparison**: Compare emotional trends across multiple characters to see dynamics and contrast over time.
- **Episode and Season Filtering**: Analyze emotional changes episode-by-episode or across entire seasons.
