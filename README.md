This project is a Django-based web application that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and visualize the emotional tones of characters from HBOâ€™s Succession. By processing and interpreting dialogue data, this tool reveals insights into the underlying emotions and sentiments of each character throughout the series, providing fans and analysts with a deeper understanding of character development and relationships.

<br>

## Features

- **Character Emotion Analysis**: Uses NLP to extract emotional tone from dialogue and attributes it to individual characters.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive visualizations of emotional trends and shifts for each character.
- **Character Comparison**: Compare emotional trends across multiple characters to see dynamics and contrast over time.

- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) : Web framework used to build the backend and handle routing.
- [PyMuPDF](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) : Python library for data extraction from PDF file.
- [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) : Powerful NLP library providing pre-trained models for sentiment analysis and text generation.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) : Versatile data analysis library for data manipulation, cleaning, and transformation in Python.
- [Plotly](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py) : Python library for creating interactive and dynamic data visualizations
